# ubertripsanalysis
This is my first solo data science project!
## about
With over 150 million active monthly users, Uber has become one of the most prominent ride-hailing service. As a beginner data exploratory analysis project, I've decided to analyze various factors of Uber's success. These factors include the amount of rides in a month, density of rides per weekday, and density of rides per location. I've included the code used and some graphs of the outcome.
Consider following me to see my journey in data science!

## findings
When looking at each graph, I've found that:
+the highest number of rides are during the week, particularly on Mondays
+there is a general rise of number of rides starting at 5am, with the peak being at 6pm.
+the region with the highest density of rides is near Manhattan, New York, and the region with the lowest density of rides is New Jersey.

## key info
+ data was found on DataCamp.com
+ Program was done in Python
