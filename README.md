# ubertripsanalysis
This is my first solo data science project!
##about
With over 150 million active monthly users, Uber has become one of the most prominent ride-hailing service. As a beginner data exploratory analysis project, I've decided to analyze various factors of Uber's success. These factors include the amount of rides in a month, density of rides per weekday, and density of rides per location. I've included the code used and some graphs of the outcome.
